	Google home-page Project started 11may2020- finished 16may2020
	It is my first work in WEB-programming. Sunday 26 april i created all necessarly files and directories for project and put there a first item which is img 
Goggle-logo.
	After that two weeks later on Monday 11may i starded to work on this project with my full concentration. I allocated 3hours time each day with breaks for working
on it. So in total i spent 18 hours to make it done.
	Obviously it looks messy in code but externally it is quite good for my first time
	What i have learned in the process of writing this code.
 - i finnaly understood some main elements of html structure, how and where to place them. Elements like;
	- <div>;<footer>;<a>;<ul>;<li>; 
 - CSS properties like:
	-id, class, inline style,
	-how to separete content into boxes, grid,
	-how to position elemnts on the page and inside of elements using: marging; padding; width; hight; text-aling; vertical aligh; possition(relative, absolute, fixed)

	And many more things which i hope to remember).
